# Streamlit Event Registration System

## Overview

The **Streamlit Event Registration System** is a web application designed to help manage and track event registrations in real-time. Built with **Streamlit**, this app allows users to register for multiple events, manage participant details, and store registration information securely. The system leverages a **CSV file** for data storage, making it simple to track participants for up to 100+ events.

### Key Features:
- **Event Registration:** Users can register for events by entering their details (name, email, etc.).
- **Real-Time Registration:** New registrations are immediately saved and displayed in the system.
- **CSV Data Storage:** The participant data is stored in a CSV file, allowing easy export and backup.
- **Participant Management:** Admin users can view and filter the participants by event.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Built using **Streamlit**, making it simple for anyone to use without requiring prior technical knowledge.

### Technologies Used:
- **Frontend:** Streamlit (for interactive web app)
- **Backend:** Python (handling app logic)
- **Data Storage:** CSV file (for storing participant data)
- **Libraries:** pandas, streamlit

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/streamlit-event-registration.git
cd streamlit-event-registration
2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed on your system. Next, create a virtual environment to manage your dependencies, and install the required packages.

bash
Copy code
# Optional: Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install the necessary dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install the required libraries such as Streamlit, pandas, and others specified in the requirements.txt.

3. Run the App Locally
To start the Streamlit app, use the following command in your terminal:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
The app will automatically open in your default web browser at http://localhost:8501.

Features
Home Page
The Home Page welcomes users and explains the basic functionality of the event registration system.
Users can navigate to the registration form or view the list of participants for different events.
Event Registration
Register Page allows participants to sign up for an event by providing details such as name, email, and event selection.
The data is stored in a CSV file, and registrations are updated in real-time.
Participant Management
View Participants allows admins to view all registered participants.
Admins can filter participants by event name, which helps in tracking registrations for individual events.
Data Storage
The registrations.csv file stores all participant details.
This simple and effective method ensures data is easily accessible, though future improvements could involve cloud-based storage solutions like AWS S3 for scalability.
Future Enhancements
Cloud Storage Integration: To scale the app and improve data security, consider integrating cloud storage solutions such as AWS S3.
Automated Notifications: Use AWS Lambda or similar services to send confirmation emails or notifications to participants after registration.
Mobile Responsiveness: Enhance the app to be fully responsive for mobile users, providing a seamless experience across devices.
Advanced Search and Filters: Implement additional search features like date, event type, etc., for better event management.

Dependencies
Here’s a list of required Python dependencies for this project:

streamlit: 1.0.0 or higher
pandas: 1.0.0 or higher
These dependencies are listed in the requirements.txt file for easy installation.

Example CSV Structure
The registrations.csv file should look like this:

graphql
Copy code
Name,Email,Phone,Event
John Doe,john.doe@example.com,1234567890,Tech Conference
Jane Smith,jane.smith@example.com,0987654321,Data Science Workshop
Each row represents a participant who has registered for an event. You can manually edit or export the CSV for further processing.
